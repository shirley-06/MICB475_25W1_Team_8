#### Agenda
- Confirm project 2 dataset
- Discuss project 2 timeline

#### Minutes

Project 2 dataset: [Impact of fresh and fermented vegetable consumption on gut microbiota and body composition: insights from diverse data analysis approaches](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1623710/full#supplementary-material)


- Reviewed study design and microbiome analysis methodology from the paper 
    - Paper mainly looked at relative abundance diversity
    - Lots of individual data present
    - Identified gaps for deeper exploration
- Brainstormed areas of focus for project 2
    - Perform a more in-depth analysis than the original study
    - Potential analytical directions:  
        - Core analysis
        - Indicator analysis
        - Functional analysis (performed using picrust2 - see module 19)
        - Paired analysis
        - Longitudinal analysis
    - Use strident cutoffs, controlling for sex, antibiotics, constipation
    - Compare pre/post dietary intervention
    - Investigate changes during washout periods - do the communities persist?
- Project 2 proposal is due Oct 26
      - QIIME2 workflow needs to be completed for the proposal

#### Action Items
- Look through the dataset and begin QIIME2 workflow (Dr. Sun will notify us it has been uploaded to the server)
- Begin background research for the proposal
- Review all the suggested analysis methods
    -  Review longitudinal analysis from the paper Chad shared
